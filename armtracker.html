            <h1>ArmTracker</h1>
            <p>Wearable sensing technology is proving useful for promoting health and fitness for the general public and athletes, however almost none is tailored to people with movement impairments.</p>
            <p>For devices targeting home-based rehabilitation, it is crucial to have robust and non-obtrusive sensors capable of measuring activity for long periods of time outside of a laboratory environment.</p>
            <p>Studies focusing on continuous monitoring of arm activity during daily life over weeks or months only use IMU sensors or accelerometers at the wrist, and do not capture multi-segment kinematics.</p>
            <p>The ArmTracker project aims at developing and evaluating a wearable sensing system that can gather continuous information on arm kinematics. This information will be used to optimize the amount of arm use during daily life, facilitate subject-specific rehabilitation programs, and ultimately overcome secondary physical deterioration.</p>
